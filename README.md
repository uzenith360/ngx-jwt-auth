## Usage

Refer to the example app for now, I will find time to do a proper documentation. 

## Post Installation

After installation, please add the following code to the styles section of angular.json `"node_modules/@uzenith360/ngx-jwt-auth/assets/styles.css"` or add this code to your project stylesheet file `@import 'node_modules/@uzenith360/ngx-jwt-auth/assets/styles.css';` whichever is more suitable for your project.
**Important: Be sure to add this before your project css styles/imports, to prevent inteference with your project css styles!**
